# Voltmeter-Ohmmeter  
-This project utilizes Atmega32 microcontroller,Potentiometer,LCD (16x2)character

# Driver Implemented:  
1-DIO driver  
2-LCD driver  
3-ADC driver    
4-KPD driver 

# How it works ?  
-when you enter the correct password , it takes you to the next window and you only have 3 attempts to try it.If you enter the password incorrectly more than 3 times,the system will shut down for 5 seconds.    
-The Next window have two choose first Voltmeter if you choose it it will show you Volt value ,second Ohmmeter and if you choose it will show you Ohm value.
